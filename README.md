# firefox.egress
firefox.egress is a Python script that extracts bookmark data from a Firefox places.sqlite file and exports it as an HTML file. The HTML file retains the organizational structure of bookmarks, and includes only the title and URL information.

By using firefox.egress, users can save time and manage their bookmarks more efficiently.

## Here are three potential use cases for this program:

* Backup: Users can export their bookmarks to an HTML file for easy access outside of Firefox.
* Custom bookmark manager: Developers building their own bookmark manager can use the program to extract bookmark data and save time.
* Team bookmark management: Administrators can easily manage and distribute bookmarks to team members.

# When using the program, there are privacy considerations to keep in mind.
Users should ensure they have permission to access the Firefox places.sqlite file, review the bookmark data for sensitive information, and store the HTML file in a secure location with limited access. They should also keep their system and any third-party utilities used in the program up-to-date with security patches to minimize risk.
